I was amazed at the fantastic harmonies and musical arrangements.Anyone who loves the movie \"\"A Mighty Wind\"\" and who loves folk music will fall in love with this album. I know I did\"\tpositive\tmusic\tneutral\r\n",
            "\"On one hand, this CD is a straight ahead instrumental rocker, but Johnny A really shows how great he is with ballads, such as his covers of \"\"Wichita Lineman,\"\" and \"\"Yes it Is.\"\"  In fact, those two ballads alone are worth the price of the CD by themselves.But Johnny A can flat kick your ass, too.  He's a biker and his tunes like Oh Yeah, In the Wind and Two Wheel Horse are named for his other hobby.  And they rock, but there's nothing cliched or tired in his style.  He always seems to be looking for new ways to say something.I saw him in person at the Triple Door in Seattle sometime in February 2005 in a power trio format and he played most of the tunes on this album.  The guy is one amazing guitar player.  He played his signature Gibson hollow body, fitted with a vibrato tailpiece (Bigsby? It was like the old Chet Atkins \"\"country gentleman\"\" model) and he utilized a battery of foot pedal effects, coming eventually through a pair of Marshall combo amps.  The guy had some of the best clean tones I've ever heard from anyone, anywhere.Basically, Johnny A is a guitarist who has complete command of the instrument.  And he's got a rocking soul that cuts loose on originals and covers alike in a style that's all his own, and that's saying something these days.  If you love great rocking/rockabilly guitar, combined with really cool ballad playing in the power trio format, this CD is just what you're looking for.  In fact, I guarantee you'll be knocked out.Five stars.\"\tpositive\tmusic\thelpful\r\n",
            "\"this band reminds me of the thrill i first got when i listened to an Atreyu Album. It dies today rip off the former bands style, but they are still a very good band.  In the over-crowded metalcore market of today, that is a rarity.  My only complaint, is that the vocalist has a beautiful singing voice (as heard on \"\"The Radiance), but more often then not goes for the screams and growls that are associated with this type of music. still 5/5 material though.Favorite songs: \"\"The Radiance,\"\" \"\"Freak Gasoline Fight,\"\" \"\"Our Disintigration,\"\" and :THe Caitliff Choir:Defeatism\"\tpositive\tmusic\tunhelpful\r\n",
            "\"Like I said I would, I finally got around to purchasing this CD. I especially like tracks 9-12. Cheap Trick is solid as always. I have been a long time fan and enjoy all their releases. If I do have any criticism at all, it is the fact that some songs sound like recycled Trick riffs. I guess it's hard to create new stuff after 30+ years. Anyway, there are some great tunes on this. Buy it like I did!\"\tpositive\tmusic\tunhelpful\r\n"
