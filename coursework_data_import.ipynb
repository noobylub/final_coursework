He's a biker and his tunes like Oh Yeah, In the Wind and Two Wheel Horse are named for his other hobby.  And they rock, but there's nothing cliched or tired in his style.  He always seems to be looking for new ways to say something.I saw him in person at the Triple Door in Seattle sometime in February 2005 in a power trio format and he played most of the tunes on this album.  The guy is one amazing guitar player.  He played his signature Gibson hollow body, fitted with a vibrato tailpiece (Bigsby? It was like the old Chet Atkins \"\"country gentleman\"\" model) and he utilized a battery of foot pedal effects, coming eventually through a pair of Marshall combo amps.  The guy had some of the best clean tones I've ever heard from anyone, anywhere.Basically, Johnny A is a guitarist who has complete command of the instrument.  And he's got a rocking soul that cuts loose on originals and covers alike in a style that's all his own, and that's saying something these days.  If you love great rocking/rockabilly guitar, combined with really cool ballad playing in the power trio format, this CD is just what you're looking for.

However, picking through all of the less notable releases from the label, the up-and-coming band, The Forecast, have stepped to the plate and scored a home run on Late Night Conversations.  The Forecast are a perfect blend of male and female vocals over a very modern rock soundtrack, executed flawlessly over a ten song full length.Late Night Conversations is an album confronting different topics ranging from relationships to the teen trend of mutilation and loathing.  The harmonies arranged by both vocalists are undeniably catching and well written and the music follows closely in suit leaving your head bobbing back and forth to the beat and your feet tapping almost involuntarily. The Forecast is not only a great recorded band, but bring the same toe tapping energy to the stage, with both great stage presence and cohesion as a band.  The Forecast will defiantly be one of the new big bands in poppier rock music, and checking their Victory Records debut out is a must for fans of the genre.\"\n",
